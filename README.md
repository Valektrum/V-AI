# V-AI

V-AI, also known as Violet, is a custom-built discord bot for my own private discord server.  
This way, I can have total control over my bot, add features along the way and have fun!

# Some of the things Violet can do:

- Play music
  - Play a song by a URL or query
    ![Play a song](./Images/play.png "Play a song")
